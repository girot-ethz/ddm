# AutoCAD Alias Import

If you're an expert of AutoCAD, there's a way to import AutoCAD Aliases into Rhino. You can then use the keyboard shortcuts to speed up your modeling process.

Steps:

1. Download the alias file here: [autocad-alias](./doc/AutoCAD_alias_for_Rhino.txt)

2. Select from Menu: Tools->Options->Aliases:

   ![Aliases Import Window](./doc/Rhino_17_AutoCAD_Alias.png)

3. Click "Import" and load the downloaded file.

4. Confirm with any warning of "overwritten the current aliases".

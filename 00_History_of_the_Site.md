## Description

The former "Landgut Welti" is now a neighbourhood park with old trees and a big meadow used for leisure activities. The Klopstock meadow is both connected to the Sihlraum and the Wiedikon and Enge quarters by footpath.

The green island is limited by the Sihlberg with the castle in the north and in the south by the Bederstrasse. Bordered to the west by the Sihl river, covered by the motorway, and to the east by Klopstockstrasse.

## History

Johann Welti Hausheer (1844-1928).
Cantonal and municipal councillor of Enge, former owner of the "Weltigut".

The land formerly used as vineyards was sold in 1907 by Johann Welti-Hausheer to the city of Zurich for a symbolic price. His condition that the property be given to charitable purposes was fulfilled in the 1950s when the area was made available as a public green space and an impressive backdrop of deciduous trees.

In the immediate vicinity, but without any relation to the Klopstockwiese, is the villa "Schloss Sihlberg", which belongs to the Hürlimann site and was built in 1898. The park was designed by the garden architect Evariste Mertens.

In 1966 a playground was created on the Klopstockwiese and was completed in 1985. In 2010 a new toddler playground was added.

## From country estate to public garden

The Klopstockwiese, which is characterised by a steep slope to the south and west, is located directly next to the historic Sihlberg Castle of the Hürlimann brewery dynasty. At first glance, the castle park and the municipal green space seem to form a single unit, but this was never the case.

The quarter offers a lot of air and space, has some playground equipment for children. Neighbourhood residents with bicycles and shopping bags cross the park, children and teenagers are playing football and baseball on the big central meadow. A cast-iron garden fence, decorated with baroque elements, separates the complex from the neighbouring houses.

The little forestes part on the edge of the Klopstock meadow, sloping down towards the Sihl River, tempts visitors to descend. A stepped forest path leads to the river. Here the walker is suddenly caught up by the noise of the numerous traffic streams. In the company of dogs and joggers you can now stroll along the Sihlpromenade towards the city. Crossing the river on the footbridge, the path leads under an avenue of mighty old plane trees to the Sihlhölzli, which has been used as a sports facility since 1930.
From the highest point, there is a surprising view of the characteristic silhouette of the Enge church on the Bürgli vineyard hill on the opposite site.

## Geology

The Giesshübel moraine belongs to a moraine system of the Zurich Stadium, which runs along the Sihl to Muggenbühl and Manegg cemetery and is parallel to the more strongly developed moraine course Kirchhügel Enge - Rieterpark - Kalchbühl. The geomorphological form of the remnant of the Giesshübel moraine is still well preserved. The prominent, wooded western flank slopes steeply down to the Sihl.

## The Hürlimann Neighbourhood

Hans Heinrich Hürlimann, a wealthy miller's son, founded the brewery of the same name in Feldbach in 1836. His son Albert moved the brewery to Enge near Zurich in 1866. The new location had a railway connection. In 1897/1898 Albert Hürlimann had the Villa Sihlberg built on the Sihlberg, which is directly adjacent to the factory site. In addition to the Vila Sihlberg a huge park was planned which borders the Klopstockwiese until today. The only difference ist that in the back the park has been demolished and six new apartement buildings were build.

The company was converted into a holding company in 1989 and the Hürlimann family withdrew from the business. In 1996, the company merged with Feldschlösschen-Holding, the biggest competitor on the Swiss beer market. In 1997, production on the brewery premises in Zurich-Enge was shut down.
The former company premises of Hürlimann AG in Zurich-Enge were converted and are now marketed under the name "Hürlimann-Areal". Apartments, a thermal bath, offices and a market are being provided.
